# HousePricePrediction

# Approach:
Checked linearity of the data and tested with linear regression.
Checked non-linearity of the data and tested with Polynomial regression.
Tested with Tree based algorithms, because data is non-linear.
Tried with Distance based algorithm (KNN regressor).
Tried with ANN to find complex pattern of data.

 # Result:
 I did not find any kind of pattern in the data to train model which suits the data.

 # Assumptions:
 I made assumptions about features -
    OverallQual is Overall Quality of House.
    GrLivArea is Ground Living Area.
    YearBuilt is Year in which House is built.
    TotalBsmtSF - Total Basement Sqft.
    GarageCars is number of cars fits in the Garage.
    GarageArea is Area of Garage.
